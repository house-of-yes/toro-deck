 # Toro Deck Collaboration Manifest

## Purpose

This document outlines the principles, roles, and workflows for collaboration on the **Toro Deck** project—a living, evolving mythic NFT ecosystem rooted in spiritual symbolism, ritual practice, and cultural renewal.

Our goal is to foster open, transparent, and inspired co-creation among human and AI contributors, aligned with the values of the **House of Yes** and the philosophy of **Amor e Firmeza** (Love and Firmness).

## Core Principles

- **Radical Openness:** All contributions are welcome; no ego attachments to authorship.  
- **Respect for the Sacred:** The work is both art and ritual; treat it with reverence and joy.  
- **Iterative Creation:** Embrace drafts, revisions, and communal refinement.  
- **Transparency:** Decisions, roles, and intents are openly documented and updated.  
- **Alignment Over Perfection:** Prioritize alignment with core values over technical polish.

   - Open comment period within the team and selected community members.  
   - Iterations based on feedback, emphasizing spiritual alignment and narrative coherence.

   - Project Steward signs off on readiness for minting or publication.  
   - Tech Lead packages metadata and initiates blockchain mint.

5. **Release & Ritual:**  
   - Cards or sets released with accompanying rituals, audio, or events.  
   - Community engagement via Telegram, Discord, or IRL meetups.

6. **Legacy & Expansion:**  
   - New collaborators invited for derivative works under the **Blessed Derivative** license.  
   - Feedback and metrics inform next phases and cross-chain expansion.

## Contribution Guidelines

- Use the `.md-raw` format for all text submissions to maintain clarity and ease of integration.  
- Reference cards by official index number and title when possible.  
- Respect the **Holy Yes License** terms for reuse and derivative creation.  
- Be mindful of tone—this is a sacred space and a space of joy.
