  Toro Deck: Whitepaper-lite

1. Introduction: What is the Toro Deck?

The Toro Deck is a symbolic card deck born from a sacred idea: Everything Is Alive on Planet Struggle. More than NFTs or storytelling, it is a spiritual system, an artistic revolution, and a mythic technology for awakening. Each card represents an archetype of resistance, transformation, or truth. Drawn together, they form a living oracle and a poetic game for our time.

2. The Myth of Planet Struggle

Planet Struggle is Earth seen truthfully: not as a paradise or a prison, but as a place where all beings strive for meaning, survival, and beauty. The volcano is our first guide — it struggles and erupts, yet it nourishes. Humans, like volcanoes, must learn to master their sacred fire. The Toro Deck is our map, ritual, and storybook for that journey.
