  Toro Deck: Whitepaper-lite

1. Introduction: What is the Toro Deck?

The Toro Deck is a symbolic card deck born from a sacred idea: Everything Is Alive on Planet Struggle. More than NFTs or storytelling, it is a spiritual system, an artistic revolution, and a mythic technology for awakening. Each card represents an archetype of resistance, transformation, or truth. Drawn together, they form a living oracle and a poetic game for our time.

2. The Myth of Planet Struggle

Planet Struggle is Earth seen truthfully: not as a paradise or a prison, but as a place where all beings strive for meaning, survival, and beauty. The volcano is our first guide — it struggles and erupts, yet it nourishes. Humans, like volcanoes, must learn to master their sacred fire. The Toro Deck is our map, ritual, and storybook for that journey.

3. Free Tier (Always Accessible)
